As inserting ERROR buttoms to report something wrong, or doing a previous verification before it is actually inserted in the database.

This project started back in 2013, when living in India I noticed that everything I listened to was unknown to most of my colleagues and friends there. At the same point I had no idea about the rythms and artists they were enjoying.
Culture Without Borders, a social and collaborative platform to bring cultures closer and expose all of us to different approaches and ideas.
